Javascript project during week 5 of Makers to make a simple thermostat.

- Javascript business logic test driven with Jasmine
- jQuery and CSS interface (using bootswatch for CSS due to lack of time)
- Connecting to the Open Weather API

Specification:

- Thermostat starts at 20 degrees
- You can increase the temperature with an up function
- You can decrease the temperature with a down function
- The minimum temperature is 10 degrees
- If power saving mode is on, the maximum temperature is 25 degrees
- If power saving mode is off, the maximum temperature is 32 degrees
- Power saving mode is on by default
- You can reset the temperature to 20 with a reset function
- You can ask about the thermostat's current energy usage: < 18 is low-usage, < 25 is medium-usage, anything else is high-usage.
